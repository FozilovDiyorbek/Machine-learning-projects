# E-commerce Price Prediction Pipeline

This project is an **end-to-end ML Engineering pipeline** for predicting product prices using **web crawled data** from e-commerce websites.  
The pipeline is fully automated with **Apache Airflow**, starting from data crawling to model training.

## Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Web Crawler] --> B[Raw Data Storage]
    B --> C[Preprocessing]
    C --> D[Feature Engineering]
    D --> E[Model Training]
    E --> F[Model Registry]
```

Step 1 – Crawler: Collects product data (title, price, rating) from an e-commerce website.

Step 2 – Preprocessing: Cleans missing values, converts prices, and normalizes data.

Step 3 – Feature Engineering: Creates additional features (e.g., rating score, price bucket).

Step 4 – Model Training: Trains a RandomForestRegressor to predict product prices.

Step 5 – Deployment (future work): Serve predictions via API (FastAPI/Flask).

# Getting Started
Clone Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ecommerce-web_crowler.git
cd Ecommerce-web_crowler
```

Create Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

---

Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

Run main.py
```
python src/main.py
```

---

Run with Airflow

Start Airflow webserver and scheduler:
```
airflow db init
airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler
```

---

# Place ecommerce_pipeline.py inside dags/ folder.
Open http://localhost:8080 and trigger the DAG.

---
# Example Output
Raw data: data/raw/products_YYYYMMDD.csv

Processed data: data/processed/cleaned_data.csv

Feature data: data/processed/features.csv

Trained model: models/price_predictor.pkl
